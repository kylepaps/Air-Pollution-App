# IQair-App
This project is a web application used to find the air pollution in a given city. It uses IQAir's AirVisual API with 4 GET requests. The functions of these requests are as follows:
* List supported countries
* List supported states in a country
* List supported cities in a state
* Get Specified city data
## Motivation
My primary motivation behind this project was to enhance my skills in JavaScript and learn React. Before this project I had used Node and Express.
### Install dependencies for server
npm install
### Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install
### Run the client and server with concurrently
npm run devStart
### Run the Express server only
npm run server
### Run the React client only
npm run client
### Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
