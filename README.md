# IQair-App
This project is a web application used to find the air pollution in a given city. It uses IQAir's AirVisual API with 4 GET requests. The functions of these requests are as follows:
* List supported countries
* List supported states in a country
* List supported cities in a state
* Get Specified city data

My primary motivation behind this project was to enhance my skills in JavaScript, learn React, and gain a better grasp of web development fundamentals.
